# RPS-Multiplayer

# This is a two player game. Each player types in their name into the input field. You can not login without a username. 

# Upon login, the player's information is logged into the firebase database. Losses, wins and username are all logged into the database.

# Each player selects either Rock, Paper or Scissors. After both players have chosen either Rock, Paper or Scissors, the winner is displayed in the middle section.

# At the bottom is a chat feature in which each player can send messages to one another remotely.

# Upon logging out, the other player will be notified within the chat that the logged out player has disconnected and a new player can now login to replace the logged out player.

# All of this information is stored in the firebase database and updated live.
